NTSA Document Management System (DMS)

This Document Management System (DMS) was developed by the attachment team at the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) to improve the handling, tracking, and communication of client-submitted documents during service processing.


Project Overview

The system is designed to:
- Digitize the process of recording client details and submitted documents.
- Improve transparency in how documents are handled across departments.
- Enable faster communication with clients through SMS notifications.
- Provide an organized, searchable, and traceable database of all submissions.


System Logic

The interface consists of:

1Ô∏è‚É£Document Submission Form
- Allows staff to enter client details.
- Enables checklisting of submitted documents.
- Each submission is assigned a unique serial number automatically.
- The form stores the data in a MySQL database upon submission.

2Ô∏è‚É£Live Submission Table (Bottom Section)
- Automatically displays all recent submissions from the database.
- Each row includes key client information and a View button.

üîçDetailed View (On Clicking "View")
- Opens a full view of the client‚Äôs submission and document list.
- Displays checkboxes to track document handling stages:
  - ‚úÖ Submitted ‚Äì always checked by default when data is recorded.
  - üü° In-review ‚Äì manually checked when the department is reviewing.
  - ‚úÖ Processed‚Äì manually checked when the service is completed.
  - ‚úÖCollected- manually checked when the client collects documents 
These checkboxes help departments coordinate and track progress for every record.

COMMUNICATION LOGIC 

- When a document is submitted and routed, the system sends an SMS notification to the client.
- The SMS informs the client of:
  - Successful submission.
  - Estimated processing time.
  - Where their request is in the process.

This enhances communication and reduces unnecessary follow-ups or delays.
